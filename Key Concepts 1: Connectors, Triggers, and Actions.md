## Overview
>To understand how Power Automate works, you must grasp the roles and relationships of connectors, triggers, and actions. They define what services you're connecting to, when the automation starts, and what the automation does.


## Relationship Between Connectors, Triggers, and Actions
- A **Connector** provides access to a service
- A **Trgger** starts the flow when a specific event occurs in that service
- **Actions** perform specific tasks within that service

### 1. Connectors
Connectors are bridges that allow Power Automate to communicate with various services and data sources. Think of them as adapters that translate Power Automate instructions into a language that other systems understand.

- Examples: SharePoint, Excel, Outlook, MS Teams AND MANY MORE!

### 2. Triggers
Triggers are the starting point of a flow. They define when the automation should begin. A trigger is an event that Power Automate monitors. When that event occurs, the flow is activated.

### 3. Actions
Actions are the individual steps that a flow performs after being triggered. They define what the flow does. Actions are executed in a specific sequence, one after the other, to achieve the desired automation.

#### Parameters
Each action has parameters that you need to configure. These parameters specify the details of how the action should be performed (e.g., the email address to send to, the file name to create, etc.).
